```
    /// Define your tab, seen at the top of the screen
    [DebugTab("Test Debug One")]
    public class TestDebugOne
    {
        /// Define your actions, it can take an optional string as seen here to define an header object that will be spawned
        /// Debug actions are grouped by Tab->Header, so you can specificy multiple equal string and they will be merged together
        [DebugAction("Test Action")]
        public void TestAction()
        {
        }
    }
